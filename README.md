# Hlawe-Lindelwa-MTN-Hackathon-SIPATJI SAKHO/ MOMO WALLET

Sipatji sakho/ momo wallet is a sub application feature to be embedded on the mtn momo app, which enables any person with a valid residential number to receive money from anyone with a registered momo account. It follows 3 steps as described below:

Sender – Access momo app and navigate to the momo wallet(/sipatji sakho) feature, then send money to any valid residential number.
Receiver – Receives an sms (message) then visits the nearest momo agent, provides the agent with the withdrawal information.
Momo Agent – Starts the withdrawal process, compiles the process then hands-over the money to the potential receiver.
NOTE: *In order to send momo wallet, sender must be a registered momo customer and must have the newly launched mtn momo app. *Receiver can get the cash weather he/she has mobile money or not. So long as the number is of the resident and valid.

The sipatji account operates when a registered momo customer send money like daily basis to their loved ones but to an mtn number which then the money is stored on a temporal database for that number. Is accessible through a unique ussd code dialed by the receiver and is withdrawn from any momo agent who is responsible to initiating withdraw process by providing the receivers number and the temporal pin for withdrawal. Money sent by any momo customer goes with an auto generated pin for withdrawal to the receivers number and expires through a stipulated time.
